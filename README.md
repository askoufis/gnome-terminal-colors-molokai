# Molokai Colorscheme for Gnome Terminal

Basically the same as Anthony25's [Solarized Colorscheme for Gnome
Terminal](https://github.com/Anthony25/gnome-terminal-colors-solarized) except there's only one
choice (Molokai) and no option for directory colors.

I hacked this together a while ago when I found
[this](https://github.com/ChadSeibert/gnome-terminal-theme-molokai) repo. The scripts didn't work
so instead I just copied the colors and hooked them into Anthony25's scripts. I'm only putting it on
github so I can use it on all my machines, present and future (assuming I stick with gnome terminal).
See Anthony25's repo for installation instructions.
